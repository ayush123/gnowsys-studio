Only small nonpolar molecules, such as oxygen can diffuse easily across the membrane. All polar molecules are transported across membranes by proteins that form transmembrane channels. These channels are gated so they can open and close, thus regulating the flow of ions or small polar molecules. Larger molecules are transported by transmembrane carrier proteins, such as permeases that change their conformation as the molecules are carried through, for example glucose or amino acids. Non-Polar molecules, such as retinol or lipids are poorly soluble in water. They are transported through aqueous compartments of cells or through extracellular space by water-soluble carriers as retinol binding protein.

Ecologists can broadly lump all life forms into one of two categories called trophic levels: 1) the autotrophs, and 2) the heterotrophs. To maintain their bodies, grow, develop, and to reproduce, autotrophs produce organic matter from inorganic substances, including both minerals and gases such as carbon dioxide. These chemical reactions require energy, which mainly comes from the sun and largely by photosynthesis, although a very small amount comes from hydrothermal vents and hot springs. A gradient exists between trophic levels running from complete autotrophs that obtain their sole source of carbon from the atmosphere, to mixotrophs (such as carnivorous plants) that are autotrophic organisms that partially obtain organic matter from sources other than the atmosphere, and complete heterotrophs that must feed to obtain organic matter. The linkages in a food web illustrate the feeding pathways, such as where heterotrophs obtain organic matter by feeding on autotrophs and other heterotrophs. The food web is a simplified illustration of the various methods of feeding that links an ecosystem into a unified system of exchange. There are different kinds of feeding relations that can be roughly divided into herbivory, carnivory, scavenging and parasitism. Some of the organic matter eaten by heterotrophs, such as sugars, provides energy.

In a column of fluid, pressure increases with depth as a result of the weight of the overlying fluid. Thus a column of fluid, or an object submerged in the fluid, experiences greater pressure at the bottom of the column than at the top. This difference in pressure results in a net force that tends to accelerate an object upwards. The magnitude of that force is proportional to the difference in the pressure between the top and the bottom of the column, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is also equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the column, i.e. the displaced fluid. For this reason, an object whose density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is either less dense than the liquid or is shaped appropriately (as in a boat), the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a reference frame which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a \"downward\" direction (that is, a non-inertial reference frame).

This difference in pressure results in a net force that tends to accelerate an object upwards. The magnitude of that force is proportional to the difference in the pressure between the top and the bottom of the column, and (as explained by Archimedes' principle) is also equivalent to the weight of the fluid that would otherwise occupy the column, i.e. the displaced fluid. For this reason, an object whose density is greater than that of the fluid in which it is submerged tends to sink. If the object is either less dense than the liquid or is shaped appropriately (as in a boat), the force can keep the object afloat. This can occur only in a reference frame which either has a gravitational field or is accelerating due to a force other than gravity defining a \"downward\" direction (that is, a non-inertial reference frame).

The hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which use the bone marrow vasculature as a conduit to the body's systemic circulation.[1] Bone marrow is also a key component of the lymphatic system, producing the lymphocytes that support the body's immune system.[2]", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [2419], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 1714, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [1], "title": "island", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "An island /'aIl@nd/ or isle /'aIl/ is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water.

The total area of the histogram is equal to the number of data. A histogram may also be normalized displaying relative frequencies.

Biologists may distinguish organic from inorganic compounds in a different way that does not hinge on the presence of a carbon atom. Pools of organic matter, for example, that have been metabolically incorporated into living tissues persist in decomposing tissues, but as molecules become oxidized into the open environment, such as atmospheric CO2, this creates a separate pool of inorganic compounds. The distinction between inorganic and organic compounds is not always clear. Some scientists, for example, view the open environment (i.e., the ecosphere) as an extension of life and from this perspective may consider atmospheric CO2 as an organic compound. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, an agency widely recognized for defining chemical terms, does not offer definitions of inorganic or organic.

Sexual differentiation is generally started by a main gene, a sex locus, then a multitude of other genes follow in a domino effect. In other cases sex is determined by environmental variables (such as temperature) or social variables (the size of an organism relative to other members of its population).

The notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults.In three phyla and one subclass of animals, endoskeletons of various complexity are found: Chordata, Echinodermata, Porifera, and Coleoidea. An endoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of sponges), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. Such a skeleton is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton' consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules or a spongin network. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; here, a mollusk exoskeleton evolved into several sorts of internal structure, the \"cuttlebone\" of cuttlefish being the best-known version.

The term weight and mass are often confused with each other in everyday discourse but they are distinct quantities.[4] The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away from any gravitating mass. There is also a rival tradition within Newtonian physics and engineering which sees weight as that which is measured when one uses scales. There the weight is a measure of the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body. Typically, in measuring someone's weight, the person is placed on scales at rest with respect to the earth but the definition can be extended to other states of motion.

Adipose tissue is derived from preadipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of lipids, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Far from hormonally inert, adipose tissue has in recent years been recognized as a major endocrine organ,[1] as it produces hormones such as leptin, estrogen, resistin, and the cytokine TNFa. Moreover, adipose tissue can affect other organ systems of the body and may lead to disease. Obesity or being overweight in humans and most animals does not depend on body weight, but on the amount of body fat--to be specific, adipose tissue[citation needed]. The two types of adipose tissue are white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The formation of adipose tissue appears to be controlled in part by the adipose gene.

All organisms have many genes corresponding to various biological traits, some of which are immediately visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some of which are not, such as blood type, increased risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.[citation needed]", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [3222, 701, 515], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 2874, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [2], "title": "using mouse", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [1784], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 2875, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [2], "title": "Mountain", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak.

Lines of constant latitude, or parallels, run east-west as circles parallel to the equator. Latitude is used together with longitude to specify the precise location of features on the surface of the Earth. Since the actual physical surface of the Earth is too complex for mathematical analysis, two levels of abstraction are employed in the definition of these coordinates. In the first step the physical surface is modelled by the geoid, a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the geoid by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the geoid is more accurately modelled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface.

In humans, olfaction occurs when odorant molecules bind to specific sites on the olfactory receptors. These receptors are used to detect the presence of smell. They come together at what is called the glomerulus. The glomerulus is a structure that transmits signals to the olfactory bulb (a brain structure located directly above the nasal cavity and below the frontal lobe).[2] Many vertebrates, including most mammals and reptiles, have two distinct olfactory systems--the main olfactory system, and the accessory olfactory system (used mainly to detect pheromones). For air-breathing animals, the main olfactory system detects volatile chemicals, and the accessory olfactory system detects fluid-phase chemicals.[3] Olfaction, along with taste, is a form of chemoreception. The chemicals themselves that activate the olfactory system, in general at very low concentrations, are called odorants.

Pairs of guard cells surround tiny stomatal airway pores (Figure 1). These tiny pores in the leaf surface are necessary for gas exchange into and out of the plant; carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the plant allowing the carbon fixation reactions of photosynthesis to occur. Oxygen (O2) exits the plant as a byproduct of photosynthesis. The opening and closing of the stomatal gas exchange holes is regulated by swelling and shrinking of the two surrounding guard cells (Figure 1). Water evaporates through the stomatal openings causing plants to lose water. Over 95% of water loss from plants can occur by evaporation (transpiration) through the stomatal pores.[clarification needed] Therefore, it is important for plants to be able to balance the amount of CO2 being brought into the plant with the amount of water escaping as a result of the open stomatal pores. Hence, the guard cells are the gate keepers of the plants ability to take in CO2 from the atmosphere for photosynthesis - while regulating how much water plants lose to the atmosphere.[1][2][3][4] Opening and closure of the stomatal pore (Figure 1) is mediated by changes in the turgor pressure of the two guard cells. The turgor pressure of guard cells is controlled by movements of large quantities of ions and sugars into and out of the guard cells. When guard cells take up these solutes, the water potential (Ps) inside the cells decreases, causing osmotic water flow into the guard cells. This leads to a turgor pressure increase causing swelling of the guard cells and the stomatal pores open (Figure 2). The ions that are taken up by guard cells are mainly potassium (K+) ions[5][6][7] and chloride (Cl-) ions.[8] In addition guard cells take up sugars that also contribute to opening of the stomatal pores.", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [2840, 2054, 270], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 3699, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [1], "title": "estrous cycle", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "The estrous cycle (also oestrous cycle; derived from Latin oestrus and originally from Greek oistros meaning sexual desire) comprises the recurring physiologic changes that are induced by reproductive hormones in most mammalian therian females.

These membrane-bound vesicles contain soluble proteins to be secreted to the extracellular environment, as well as membrane proteins and lipids that are sent to become components of the cell membrane. However, the mechanism of the secretion of intra-vesicular contents out of the cell is very different from the incorporation of ion channels, signaling molecules, or receptors at the cell membrane. While for membrane recycling and the incorporation of ion channels, signaling molecules, or receptors at the cell membrane complete membrane merger is required, for cell secretion there is transient vesicle fusion with the cell membrane in a process called exocytosis, dumping its contents out of the cell's environment. Examination of cells following secretion using electron microscopy, demonstrate increased presence of partially empty vesicles following secretion. This suggested that during the secretory process, only a portion of the vesicular content is able to exit the cell. This could only be possible if the vesicle were to temporarily establish continuity with the cell plasma membrane, expel a portion of its contents, then detach, reseal, and withdraw into the cytosol (endocytose). In this way, the secretory vesicle could be reused for subsequent rounds of exo-endocytosis, until completely empty of its contents.[1]", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [2840, 2417, 2021], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 3701, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [1], "title": "matrix", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "", "left_subjecttype_of": [], "prior_nodes": [], "posterior_nodes": [], "plural": null, "id": 3702, "subjecttype_of": []}, {"contains_subtypes": [], "member_of_metatype": [1], "title": "bronchi", "right_subjecttype_of": [], "altnames": [], "contains_members": [], "content": "A bronchus (plural bronchi, adjective bronchial) is a passage of airway in the respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs.
